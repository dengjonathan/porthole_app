## The automatic screen reader for people on the go ##

## Increase your reading speed and reduce eye strain with Porthole ##

## Summary ##
  > Porthole automates screen traversal. When reading an article, don't move your eyes, Porthole will move the words for you.

## Problem ##
  > We all read a lot of articles online everyday, causing eye strain from the repetitive traversing over a screen. Additionally, websites that are meant for web browsers aren't optimized for small screens, such as smart watches.  Instead of trying to make everything responsive (increasing development time), include a feature to flash your articles to readers, allowing to read from a watch on the train without having to strain their eyes.

## Solution ##
  > Porthole will flash articles to you word by word, increasing your reading speed and reducing your eye strain because you don't have to change the area you look.  Let Porthole automate your screen traversal. Don't move your eyes. Also take the most advantage of small mobile/ device screens.
